* left subtree matches right subtree item multiple times
    ( e.g. multiple network interfaces without additional parameters)
	( {% for i in range(num_ifs) %} <interface ... </interface> {% endfor %}
    this is quite complicated since we need a best-match algorithm or indicate
    how many additional parameters are defined. this may also be solved by some
    kind of workaround
* implement 'created' (running but not defined)
* implement "saved" state by adding a path to a savefile
* test text encoding (UTF8, use to_native)
* implement sections: ignore section or ensure section is present based on
    xpath. this may as well mean that a xml argument is not necessary.
    (e.g. <model fallback='allow'>Haswell</model> will always be replaced)
* test python versions 2.6 and 3
* implement timeout (wait)
* log libvirt error handler messages.
* state=undefined and latest=true throws error
* defining transient domain fails
* maybe do all state handling in state machine class?
* write comments and cleanup code
* autostart
* virt_vol missing many features and needs a lot of improvement
